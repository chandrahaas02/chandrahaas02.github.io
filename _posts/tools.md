Yeah the tools you see on this new blog are completely running on client side (on your machine) so the whole objective of this tools are exploring and using the raw capabilities of the client system , I strongly belive client systems today can handle some good of processing tasks like image conversions , table filterings , and light video editing as well so i want to explore these things and gert a quick prototype of those things

Some of my thoughts are live and some are under construction so yeah next time when you think having a sidecar for small tasks like convert every image to jpeg for storage or extracting a thumbnail for a video you can 100% relay on clients system as it can handle on behalf of you


And Since most of my tools are prototypes and not of production quality i will also try to suggest the tools which bagan with the same principles i used to prototype and that will run mostly on client side which ensure your data saftey and privacy feel free to suggest some client side capabilities you guys are using so that I can showcase them here or learn myself to prototype those
