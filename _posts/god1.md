Well microsoft launched windows11 today but we have seen many features underhood in windows10 alredy which makes windows a much better place for coding here are few features I liked the most let's us see :

1. **Winget**: This is the feature which is updated a lot in recent times this is a cli tool for installing packages on a go without using your old styled browser it has almost all packages and it is opensource application so you can add any package if you want to
2. **powershell**: Yes the new power shell is so good that it can really called as windows terminal as it can mimic almost all tasks
3. **edge** : This may be wiered but yes it so much nice that we can find a good alternative for chrome and firefox
