## The problem
During our summer vacation after second year my friend asked me that let's create a bot which plays a pong
Then at the very next day I wrote the code to the bot (well the trick I used) I want to share the trick and the code
of my game well you tell me whether **IT IS A BOT OR NOT**


## The Idea
The basic Idea of creating a bot is just moving bot along with the change in y-coordinate of the pong ball
So by this I created a fail-proof bot which can not be beaten ever


## The code
well I create this whole process using turtle graphics as this doesn't require big graphics
you can find code in my github repo of blog and I will discuss this here

```python
z=ball.ycor()
paddle_b.sety(z)
```


## conclusion
You don't need ai to automate things just a small tricks would solve it


you can find full code at [here](https://github.com/chandrahaas02/blog/blob/main/pong.py)
