## problem
I need a good place to store my notes but I am profound linux user and fed up with writing notes using html and libreoffice notes format
and plain text didn't **highlight** things which were very useful

So my initial plan was for witting in markdown and converting to html and uploading to my github to store things
but the problem with this approach is There is not interface to see all my notes at a time as github supports only static pages
So I shifted to blogger to write things but the problem with ***blogger*** is it is completely online I felt it not my cake
So I used flask to host my blogs and uploaded it on **heroku** which  is very decent solution


## WHY this
One day while I was randomly surfing through internet I found which basically says how to maintain a data science portfolio using github pages
so I just randomly visited github pages and there i say this **we can maintain our blog which are written in markdown by using gems and jekyll**
So I liked this Idea and started dig it deep and found the beautiful tutorial [Mr raymond](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWzwUIYZpnJuT0sH4BN56P5oWTdHJiTNq)
So by following that one I started this as

> By this I got a great platform for my requirements
