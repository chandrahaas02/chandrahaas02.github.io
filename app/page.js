        Hello! I'm Chandrahaas, a DevOps Engineer passionate about crafting scalable and efficient systems that can handle whatever you throw at them. I recently graduated from IIT Hyderabad with a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence, where I built a strong foundation in operating systems, data structures, and algorithms.
        My journey in DevOps began at Storyxpress, where I've had the opportunity to implement security best practices, optimize cloud infrastructure, and even lead the migration of our Python templating engine. I thrive on tackling complex challenges and am always eager to learn and experiment with new technologies.
        When I'm not immersed in code, you might find me exploring the latest tech trends, hiking, or trying to improve my astrophotography skills (the stars are the ultimate scalable system, right?).
        Feel free to check out my projects and experience â€“ and if you have an interesting challenge, let's connect!
