I have seen lots of videos , I guess you also have seen people telling bro during my school time I was taught pythogoreas therom which is no use for me in current time instead of that can't our education system teach something useful so today let me share my thoughts about the education in India the good and Bad , I will divide this topic into 3 parts

1. Choice
2. Maturity
3. Conclusion


## The Choice
When I was in my 1st class, That was the time when Abdul Kalam sir was stepping out from his presidential role of India then everyone was talking about him like how he was a great scientist , how he worked on missiles , how scholar he was that was the time I thought I would also become a scientist like him , we There is nothing wrong in idealogy but at that moment of time I don't know anything about missiles blutnly saying I even don't know how to spell science but later when I started growing I understood how chemistry works, how physics works etc.. That then I understood how difficult it is to build a missle or rocket or even aeroplane and what it takes to build it,then at some point I thought myself maybe I am not right for that , I didn't devlop a very keen intrest over chemistry for some reason, then I learn't about computers and grown intrest towards it and working in that field today

So In the above story see what I did I thought of becoming something and understood how things works and thought may it is not for me and left it so basically as a kid you might think of becoming anything or maybe sometimes thinks of becoming everything but yeah that may not be possible how would rule out of these posssibilities is by learing the basics of those things and try to understand whether something might be a good fit for you or not so yeah education is the way to try out everything a little bit to get you in a postion where you can explore all those things, and I guess this is very well done in current day education system
